# Power-BI---PwC-Certifications

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Achievement! ðŸš€
Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve successfully completed the Power BI Job Simulation offered by PwC through Forage. Over the course of this program, I worked on practical tasks in key areas such as:

âœ… Call Centre Trends
âœ… Customer Retention
âœ… Diversity & Inclusion

This experience has deepened my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Power BI, enhancing my ability to derive actionable insights from data.
A big thank you to PwC, Forage, and the program leaders Natalie Vogel, Elisabeth Ziller, and Tom Brunskill for this incredible opportunity.
